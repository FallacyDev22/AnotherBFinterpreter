# AnotherBFinterpreter

I recently became interested in compilers and since one works under the table.
I know that this little Brainf*** interpreter is not even close to what a compiler for a "serious" language is, but I think it already gave me a distant idea of ​​what they really are.

Feel free to use or modify this code as you like! Likewise, any opinion or comment will always be welcomed!
